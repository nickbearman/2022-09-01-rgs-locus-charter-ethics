We're going to talk a little bit about Ethics and why I think they are important

::: incremental
-   The Locus Charter
-   Examples from Practical GeoAI Ethics Workshop at OS
-   How it applies to Spatial Data
-   How it applies to GIScience

# When we are thinking about ethics

# Data is key

-   Data
-   Big data
-   Spatial data
-   Geospatial data ....

## Applying ethics is a journey

-   How you apply ethics has no "one" answer

    -   There is no "ethics in geospatial expert"

::: fragment
-   It is like questions my course participants ask:

    -   "How can I apply time series analysis to spatial data?"
:::

::: fragment
-   It depends!
:::

::: fragment
-   What are you trying to achieve?
-   What data are you using?

::: notes
**It is a starting point / a framework to think about ethics**

Read through principles
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

These principles are fine, but what do they actually mean?

-   It depends!

::: fragment
It is a framework, a process:

-   "to support responsible practice when working with location data"

-   "an approach to working with location data, to help people who want to do the right thing work with data in the right way"

-   "a checklist of things to think about"
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

These principles are fine, but what do they actually mean?

-   It depends on your project!

::: fragment
There are lots of ways of using it.
:::

::: fragment
There is no wrong way - we just need to use it

# Practical GeoAI Ethics Workshop

::: notes
**16th June 2022 at Ordnance Survey**

Focus on how to apply this in the real world
:::

::: notes
We talked a bit about the principles
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Order the Locus Charter Principles

-   We were asked to order the principles

-   From **most important** to **least important**

-   Six groups

-   Quite a bit of variation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Founding Principles {.smaller auto-animate="true"}

1.  Realize Opportunities
2.  Understand Impacts
3.  Do No Harm
4.  Protect the Vulnerable
5.  Address Bias
6.  Minimize Intrusion
7.  Minimize Data
8.  Protect Privacy
9.  Prevent Identification of Individuals
10. Provide Accountability

::: notes
This is as they are on the website

## Ordering Exercise {.smaller auto-animate="true"}

1.  Do No Harm
2.  Protect the Vulnerable
3.  Provide Accountability
4.  Protect Privacy
5.  Understand Impacts
6.  Prevent Identification of Individuals
7.  Minimize Data
8.  Address Bias
9.  Minimize Intrusion
10. Realize Opportunities

::: notes
This is our output
:::

## Ordering Exercise {.smaller}

1.  Do No Harm (#2)
2.  Protect the Vulnerable (#4)
3.  Provide Accountability (#10)
4.  Protect Privacy (#8)
5.  Understand Impacts (#1)
6.  Prevent Identification of Individuals (#9)
7.  Minimize Data (#7)
8.  Address Bias (#5)
9.  Minimize Intrusion (#6)
10. Realize Opportunities (#1)

**Background from Denise McKenzie:\
** - she presented the principles without numbers\
- they are not in a specific order\
- but they are in a specific order\
- and much discussion was had about this order.\
- start with what you can do, not what you can't do. (realise opportunities)\
- supposed to be enabling, not restrictive (do no harm lower down) - *order different here to the website*

-   Ordering depends on your project

-   There is no specific 'order'

**Environmental sciences** & **Social sciences**

think about ethics in different ways

::: fragment
*There is no one path through the forest*
:::

::: fragment
::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
Environmental science focuses on the **environment**
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
Social sciences focuses on **people**
:::
:::
:::

::: fragment
This is not new to geographers!
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Problems with principles

Is they look good and people say yes they to them

::: fragment
But does this impact what actually happens?
:::

::: fragment
-   *Often no*
:::

::: fragment
Who is accountable?
:::

::: fragment
If nobody (or everybody) is accountable, nothing happens

-   *Jacqui Ayling, Moving from Principles to Practice*
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## So, how do we apply them?

-   Jo Walsh & Mel Marochov, Ordnance Survey

-   AI / Deep Learning Models

-   **Model Cards** to document their machine learning models

    -   How they can be used
    -   Ethical considerations that should go hand-in-hand with model development
        -   Bias in the input data
        -   Energy cost to run the model
    -   Attempted to automate as much as possible - otherwise it won't get done

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## So, how do we apply them?

-   Ruth Bowyer, Alan Turing Institute / Kings College London, [TwinsUK](twinsuk.ac.uk)

-   Using individuals data in a range of research projects

-   They have a research panel with participants on it

-   Engagement with participants is key in their trust in the research

-   Being open with their research builds confidence with participants data

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## So, how do we apply them?

-   Jeni Tennison, [Connected by Data](connectedbydata.org)

-   Public Trust is key

-   Value jugdements are needed to enact the Locus Charter principles

-   **Who** is making these value judgements is key

-   Currently there is a lot of **theory** but not a lot of **implimentation**

::: notes
RGS - useful for schools / a-level, but good introduction ODI - how does your organisation think about ethics? What are the next steps? W3C - technical note, some interesting discussions
:::

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## How do we apply this to our work?

-   a question for us

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### *An aside - particularly for ERCs*

One thing that came clearly to me was this area has two sides:

-   policy side
-   practical implementation side

They are related - but know what you are interested in.

I'm not interested in policy - just practical implementation.

How do we view this? How do teach this?

*What the policies are - to me, this is less important.*

## Thanks very much!
